Hello! My name is Tanner Smith. I graduated from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu) with a bachelor's degree in [computer science](http://www.cc.gatech.edu). I like, among many other things, Coldplay, The Shins, Foo Fighters, and Doctor who.

I love learning new things, aviation, and the history of computers.
