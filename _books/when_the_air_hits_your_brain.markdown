Picked this up as a part of a 2 for 1 sale. It's a great book written by a neurosurgeon who writes about his most memorable experiences about his process of becoming a neurosurgeon and his career overall. There are enjoyable stories and not-so-enjoyable stories. Frank does a good job explaining any medical jargon that happens to come up, making this a easy read. Would recommend.
