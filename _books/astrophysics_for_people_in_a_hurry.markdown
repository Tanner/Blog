This book is a slightly more in depth than [Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey), so if you've seen that it'll be a bit of review. I enjoyed the latter half of the book, and it's awesome overall as Neil himself reads the audio book. Good, easy read.
