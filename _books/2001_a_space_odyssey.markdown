I enjoyed the movie, despite being an hour or two longer than you think it would be, but had never read the book (probably because I thought the book would be a couple hundred pages longer than you think it would be). Somewhat surprisingly, I found the book exciting to read. The audio book I had even had an intro by Arthur C. Clarke (which was super cool) and a quite movie-accurate voice of HAL.
