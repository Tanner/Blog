I don't really know why I read a book about Betty White, but she's nice so I figured a book from her would be good. It's a short listen (about two hours). I learned a thing or two about her I didn't know (not that I keep up with Betty White in the news). There might be other places to learn these stories, but you can't turn down a book read by the author.
