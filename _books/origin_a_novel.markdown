In many ways this was your standard Dan Brown novel: Robert Langdon, religious iconography, and some scenario involving him. I really enjoyed the technology aspects of this book, but found the pacing to be odd and quite accelerated compared to Brown's other books. This book is a good read, but I wouldn't suggest it as your first Dan Brown book.
