I wanted to read this book of John Green's as I heard via his YouTube channel that he was writing a new book. And when I did heard (watched?) about this, I suddenly connected the dots that the John Green I watched also wrote a book I've heard a fair amount about. So I decided to read it. The story was good and I enjoyed the characters, despite having to remember exactly how old they were part way through the book. There's sad parts and happy parts, but I liked it.
