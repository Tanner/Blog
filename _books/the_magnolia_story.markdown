We've started watching a lot of HGTV house renovation shows. We got hooked on [Fixer Upper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_Upper_(TV_series)) with the lovely renovations in Waco, Texas. This book explains a bit of Chip and Joanna's past including the start of their relationship and the show itself. It's nice that it's read by them, but it can feel a little forced. It's a good read, but probably won't be as enjoyable without seeing the show.
