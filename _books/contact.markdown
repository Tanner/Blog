I remember reading this book long ago when I was a kid and had gotten really into space after seeing the movie. Reading it again has left me with a better impression of the characters and story, as probably pre-teen me had skimmed over some parts or clearly forgotten some. The movie did a great job, if not better, at representing the story than the book. I need to see it again.
