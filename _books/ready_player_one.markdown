I hadn't read this book in the past as I was told that you had to know a lot of about 1980's culture and video games. I thought the trailer looked good so I figured I would give the book a shot. You don't need any 80's culture or video game knowledge. This book goes fine without that. This is probably one of my favorite books now and it makes me excited about the future.
