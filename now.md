Hey, this is stuff I'm doing now. Well, not _right_ now, but pretty recently.[^1]

I think I'll keep this a bulleted list.

I'm still reading _[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)_. I haven't read it recently though.

I'm trying to get into a routine of drawing again, but that's hard.

I'm planning a trip to New York.

I'm working hard at work.
