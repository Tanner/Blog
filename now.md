Hey, this is stuff I'm doing now. Well, not _right_ now, but pretty recently.[^1]

I'm not sure if I want this to be a bullet listed or not.

I'm currently reading _[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)_. It's pretty good so far - an easy read.

I'm also training for a 5K, which I've never done before.

I might start up a podcast, we'll see how that goes.

I'm also embarrassed at the small number of items I have on this list. ðŸ˜•
