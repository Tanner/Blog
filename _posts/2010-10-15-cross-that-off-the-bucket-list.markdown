[![](http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/things_completion.png "Cross Country Cross Off")](http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/things_completion.png)I was adding something to the [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) to-do list application's "Someday" list when I noticed I still had "Fly Across the Country" on the list. Seeing as I have [already completed](http://airborne.revenir.org/) this item on my Bucket List, I crossed it off.

One down, a lot more to go...
