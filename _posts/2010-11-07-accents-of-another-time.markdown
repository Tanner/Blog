It is always interesting to go over Shakespeare in high school and read his "ye olde English" way of writing. Why is it interesting? Reading writings from that century are interesting because it is different from ours \- the way writers wrote, formatted their text, words they used, how they spelt their words, etc...

The article [here](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/8099) shows exactly how linguists today reverse engineered the pronunciation of words that Shakespeare used in his plays. If you watch the video above, you can hear a few words which are spelt the same as what we use today, but sound very much different. I find it very interesting how things were different in the past than they are today. Evolution is a very interesting thing.

If you're interested in learning speaking like Shakespeare did, you can read [this PDF](http://www.paulmeier.com/OP.pdf) the professor who taught the students in the video above and in the article.
