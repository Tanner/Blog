This just in, we have a new domain name! Wordpress.com was nice for something simple, but I wasn't happy with what all I was limited to doing so I thought I might as well do this. I mean, I had the power to so why not?

So, here we are, get comfy. Few things are still to be done, but its not too shabby so far.
