title: Why I Stopped Using My Favorite Twitter App

Yesteray I wrote [a blog post](app-resuming-behavior.html) related to my Twitter application of choice on Android, Tweedle.

To sum that post up, I had trouble using the application and told the developer about it. He gave his reasoning for doing it that way and I disagree with it as every other application in both Android and iOS function the exact opposite way. Even Google's documentation mentioned against doing it the way Tweedle currently behaves.

After he ended our conversation about it[^1], I found I couldn't access Tweedle's tweets anymore. Twitter was giving me a authentication error, which after a bit of Googling turns out to be code for "you've been blocked".

I posted about [this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TannerLD/status/304376679273476098) mentioning both the official Tweedle account and the developer's personal account. I saw nothing harsh about my suggestions or criticisms.

The developer of Tweedle responded back saying this:

> Its my application, not yours. I choose how it works. You were being hypercritical so I chose to not listen to it anymore.[^2]

Ok. Yes, it is your application, you can do whatever you want with it. I respect that, but I have a problem when you decide that your application is different than all the other applications that exist and go against some basic user experience guidelines.

I don't believe I was being hypercritical. I know I can be hypercritical about things, but I don't feel in [this case](https://twitter.com/TannerLD/status/303647019766009856), [this case](https://twitter.com/TannerLD/status/303722873133088768), or [this case](https://twitter.com/TannerLD/status/303549550189228032) that I was.

I was giving feedback because you [ask](https://twitter.com/tweedleapp/status/303717824248029185) [for](https://twitter.com/tweedleapp/status/302941606506553344) [feedback](https://twitter.com/tweedleapp/status/277944692476358656).

Come on, you asked for people's opinions, and then you get mad at what they say. Seriously?

As I was looking through trying to find my conversations with the Tweedle twitter account I found lots of harsh tweets and users complaining.

> Man the dev of @tweedleapp is one class act. Highly recommend his appâ€¦. By uninstalling it. What a prick.[^3]

> Wow a f\*\*k you very much from a dev. Way to talk down to an end user smh RT @tweedleapp (cont)[^4]

> what the..i am baffled as to how a dev replies like this.. RT @tweedleapp: @AmaSan25 Your face needs to be pushed in.[^5]

> &#64;Bgill55 @tweedleapp it's very belittling. We were all end users of some type once. Since when did android devs get a salary to act this way[^6]

> &#64;tweedleapp @peleroberts from anyone. A lot of people ask and rely on my recommendations. And you and your app just fell off.[^7]

Woah. Seriously? This is downright wrong and not the way to treat your users. Just because your application is free does not give you the right to walk all over them.

The developer has been called out on this [multiple](https://twitter.com/LovellKid/status/302532442743533569) [times](https://twitter.com/LovellKid/status/302531535574274048), and what does he say?

> &#64;LovellKid I stand by my words regardless of the account I post them with.[^8]

> &#64;LovellKid This is not a competition. I talk to my users bluntly. If you cannot understand that then that is how it is going to be.[^9]

This is not how you should treat your user's from *your brand's official twitter account*.

Especially don't act like this if you say this [on the website's front page](http://www.tweedleapp.com/) (emphesis mine):

> Tweedle is young, it is still growing. Although we may not have all of the features the other clients have, we are doing our best to make that possible. **We take all feature requests and feedback seriously and we strive to provide the best customer service possible.**

I can't say any more than this. Treat people as you wish to be treated. We expect the brand's official Twitter account to be professional and polite. If you act like this, you give a bad name to independent developers.

I won't be using Tweedle anymore.
