One of the first things to post on this newly created blog is to post my goals for the Georgia Tech English 1101 class on "Being Born Digital".

Like most goals, these are too specific, but I feel they are still essential for me to become a better communicator in the English language.
<ul>
	<li>Become a more fluent writer</li>
	<li>Increase my ability to write more in-depth</li>
	<li>Increase ability to express myself more through writing</li>
	<li>Improve thought-processing of other types of writing and opinions</li>
	<li>Improve understanding of other modes of writing, especially rarely used ones and ones requiring understanding such as images</li>
	<li>Increase ability to understand and create non-verbal forms of communication</li>
	<li>Increase ability to perform orally on a topic from a speech or from an idea</li>
</ul>
