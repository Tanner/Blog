Just a tiny post to say that I've got a about.me profile now. Hurrah! You can access it by clicking [here](http://about.me/tannerld).[About.me](http://about.me/) is supposed to be all about consolidating social profiles and what not, which is does well, but I mainly like how it looks. Nice big picture of someone, a bit of bio, and then links to their various social networks or sites. Simple. Nice.Yep - so that is it for now. Finals for college are almost done and over with, but still got one more to go so I'll get back to studying. Not sure why I am telling you that. Anywho.
