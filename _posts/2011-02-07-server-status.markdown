[![](files/2011/02/uptime.png "Uptime")](files/2011/02/uptime.png)I found [statusdot](https://statusdot.com/) a few days ago and the idea seemed interesting so I signed up for the free beta and set up my site. Now if you point your browser to [status.tanner-smith.com](http://status.tanner-smith.com/), you get a page hosted by statusdot that shows my site's (ergo server) uptime.

Neat, no? I think its a nice little service that is easy to set up and could be quite useful to sites with a bit of traffic which may cause the site to go down frequently.
