I guess I should write about the new design.

Hey, look a new design!

It's not perfect and I don't think it'll ever be done.
There's a few more things I'd like to do, such as images with captions and maybe change the color of the footnote JavaScript things to match everything else[^1].[^2]

But that's all later. For now, let's celebrate!

[Let me know](https://twitter.com/tannerld) if you think I messed up something.

[^1]: Like this one. So embarrassing. How did I miss that?!
[^2]: Not sure if footnotes go before or after the period. Can I do both?
