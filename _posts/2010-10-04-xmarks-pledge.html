Just got an update in my RSS feeds about a pledge for Xmarks to stay alive. I <a href="http://www.tanner-smith.com/2010/09/27/xmarks-is-dying/">previously wrote</a> about Xmarks dying due to finances among other things. The creators are willing to give it a second chance if the pledge succeeds.
 
The idea of the pledge is to have a "Xmarks Premium" service where the user would pay a fee to use the service. Using the money gathered from the service, Xmarks would be able to continue to live. The details of the pledge are shown below:

<blockquote>"I will commit to $10 - $20 per year for Xmarks Sync but only if 100,000 other people will do the same."

â€” Xmarks Founders, Mitch, Todd, Dave, Penny, and James </blockquote>

If you are interested in pledging, you can do so by viewing the pledge page <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/XmarksPremium">here</a>.
