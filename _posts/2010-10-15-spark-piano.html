Very neat "polyplasmic acrophone". I have no idea what that means, but in simple terms it seems to be a generic spark piano. The guys who made it plan to make more groups of the "instruments" together.

During the video it sounds like he is playing Tocca and Fugue, but the pitch and volume are so low I'm having trouble hearing it. I hope the group performs more pieces with it and labels the songs so I can spend more time enjoying the song and not trying to guess what the song is.
