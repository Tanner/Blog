This morning, around 9:35 AM, one of my friends, Chris, killed me and made me a zombie.I thought Chris was my friend, but apparently the urge for human brains is stronger than a friendship.Thanks Chris, now I can get the free marshmallows all the humans throw at us to stun us. At least I survived one day.
