After I had breakfast this morning I found <a href="http://twitter.com/gtcomputing/status/22524181315">this tweet</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/gtcomputing">gtcomputing</a> about young tweens and their affect on the market for technology.

<a href="http://www.financialpost.com/news/tiny+power+shoppers/3452047/story.html">Here</a> is a link directly to the article.

I don't have time for a full reflection at the moment as I am waiting outside my CS 1331 class with a few friends, but I might write one later.
