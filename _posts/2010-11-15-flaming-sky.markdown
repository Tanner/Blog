[![](http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/3743958686_0c12cd4983.jpg "Flaming Sky")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/eyedeaz/3743958686/)When I first saw this image my first thought was that the image was awesome. Very lucky timing and location with the taking of that picture. In the image, the sky is actually not on fire, but it is just some lucky light refraction in the clouds at a concert from the sunset.

My second thought was that the image looks a lot like when the Doctor ignites the sky to prevent the evil Sontarans from taking over in the Doctor Who episode "[The Poison Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poison_Sky)". An image of when that happens can be seen [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Poison_Sky.jpg).
