title: I'd like a coffee app

In iOS 8 Apple announced (Health)[http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/health/], which is a neat way to store health and fitness information. I'm interested in quantified-self, so I filled out my medical ID in it and began entering some of the basic information (weight, height, etc...).

However, that's not what this post is about. I noticed that there is a nutritional caffine dataset where you can enter your caffinie consumption in milligrams. 

That's really neat as you could track your coffee consumption. However, I don't know how many milligrams of caffine are in a latte or any other kind of coffee. It'd be neat if there was an app where I could enter "I had a latte" and it could enter the miligrams of caffine into Health.

It'd be a nice, simple, "only does one thing" kind of app. Someone should make it.
