I thought it'd be fun to take a [live photo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRRBs71p7II) and make it a nice video for my [about](/about) page. There's not really any images of me on here and I always like it when someones site has at least one picture of them. It's nice to see what people look like.

I used [Lively](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lively-export-live-photo-to/id1049711205?mt=8) on iOS to export a movie from a live photo.

From there, I used [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to [crop the video](http://video.stackexchange.com/questions/4563/how-can-i-crop-a-video-with-ffmpeg) and [remove the audio](
http://superuser.com/questions/268985/remove-audio-from-video-file-with-ffmpeg).[^1]

I think the result is nice. I might rotate out the video periodically just to make things exciting.

[^1]: Turns out cropping video seems like an otherwise hard problem.
