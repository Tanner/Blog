Really neat video of a 3D-like projection on an old clock tower that shows the past 600 years of events on the clocks. It is very much like [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0XKmU5hF5s) that has been on YouTube for a while, but in a bit more of a practical way.<center><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/15749093" frameborder="0" height="710" width="400"></iframe></center>[The 600 Years](http://vimeo.com/15749093) from [the macula](http://vimeo.com/themacula) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).
