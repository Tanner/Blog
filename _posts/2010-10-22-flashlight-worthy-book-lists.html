Ever had a book where you would stay up under the covers at night with a flashlight to finish reading? That is what all these books are.

From the site, Flashlight Worth is the following.

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We don't list the best selling books — we list the best books.
<li>We don't list 6,072 results when you search for John Irving (including 251 versions of Garp!) — we list only his best books just once.
<li>We don't make you hunt around for hours to find the very best books on parenting — we do the work for you.</blockquote>

What books are the best in your collection?
