title: (Another) Editorial in The Technique

I wrote another editorial for this week's <em>Technique</em> on how I've taken notes in my college career and how it has changed.

The <em>Technique</em> is Georgia Tech's student newspaper. I've been on the editorial board for a few semesters by now helping with the website and other related functions of the <em>Technique's</em> internal runnings and its outward appearance.

You can read <a href="http://nique.net/opinions/2013/10/24/the-pen-is-definitely-mightier-than-the-mac/">the article online</a> at the <em>Technique's</em> website.

If you're actually on Georgia Tech's campus, you can find it on page eight in the paper.
