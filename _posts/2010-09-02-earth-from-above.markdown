I found this video in my RSS feeds for Gizmodo which has quite an affect on me. Never do you ever really see the Earth rotating around this fast. Usually you just see a short shot or even a long shot in the movies really where the Earth just kind of sits there. Not terribly exciting or as fascinating as this is.

Its funny how much of the big picture we lose sight of each day. And not just the big picture as in your life big picture, more like the literally BIG picture. Kind of makes you feel lonely with the urge to be an astronaut...

If you want to see the rest of the videos much like the one above, click the source link below.
