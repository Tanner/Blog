This is so funny I have to post it.If you have never heard of rickrolling I recommend reading [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) and then watching [this](http://www.amazon.com/).Amazon has gotten a little crafty with their web page "deals" on the bottom of their main page. If you know the internet meme, I recommend going to [Amazon's website](http://www.amazon.com/), scrolling to the bottom, and doing a little reading in the bottom right hand corner.Who says big companies can't have a sense of humor?Source: [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5653346/not-even-amazon-will-spare-you-a-rickrolling)
