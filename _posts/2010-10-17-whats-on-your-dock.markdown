[![](http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dock-1024x81.png "Dock")](http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dock.png)I have wanted to do this post after reading [Ajai's post](http://www.ajaimk.com/2010/08/26/whats-on-your-dock/) about it, but have always been too busy to do it or have forgotten about it when doing other posts. So here I am typing up this post during CS 1331 lecture.- Finder
- [Mailplane](http://mailplaneapp.com/) - Trial version for a replacement GMail client. Not really sure if I'd spend money for it yet.
- [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/landing_chrome_mac.html?hl=en)
- [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com/) - The news feed reader that has all my organized feeds.
- [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) - My to-do manager of choice.
- [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password) - The most awesome password manager in the world. Uber-pwnage.
- iTunes
- [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/) - Pretty awesome FTP client. I need to upgrade to the latest version.
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) - My current Java IDE of choice.
- [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) - Virtualization software that runs Windows and Ubuntu great.
- [Skype](http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home) - Instant messaging for Skype friends.
- [Adium](http://adium.im/) - Instant messaging for every other protocol other than Skype.
- [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/) - Twitter client.
- Google Quick Search Box - Google's version of an application launcher like Quicksilver or LaunchBar. It's ok.
- Georgia Tech Year 1 Folder - All my Georgia Tech work for year number one.
- [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) Folder
- Robotics - All my old FIRST robotics stuff from high school. I could probably remove this since I'm in college now.
- Extracted Files Folder - Where extracted folders from compressed files in my Downloads folder go.
- Download Folder - Where downloads exist.
- Trash - The doomsday of files.
So that is my dock.
