title: Editorial in The Technique

I wrote an editorial for this week's <em>Technique</em> on Georgia Tech's use of brands.

The <em>Technique</em> is Georgia Tech's student newspaper. I've been on the editorial board for a few semesters by now helping with the website and other related functions of the Technique's internal runnings and its outward appearance.

You can read <a href="http://nique.net/opinions/2013/09/12/tech-brands-need-to-prioritize-quality/">the article online</a> at the Technique's website.

If you're actually on Georgia Tech's campus, you can find it on page seven in the paper.
