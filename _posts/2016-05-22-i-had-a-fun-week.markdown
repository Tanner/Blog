I had a fun week last week.

On Tuesday, I met up with [Yasmine Evjen](https://www.relay.fm/people/yasmineevjen) and [Russell Ivanovic](https://www.relay.fm/people/Russellivanovic) of Relay FM's [Material](https://www.relay.fm/material) podcast.

It was fun to meet the people behind one of my favorite podcasts, even if I was a little awkward.[^1] I wish we could have chatted longer, but I'm glad that I got to meet them. Plus they had a busy week ahead![^2]

I can't wait to go to [RelayCon](http://www.extras.relay.fm/blog/2016/4/4/announcing-relaycon-wwdc-2016) during WWDC and meet other Relay podcasters.

Yesterday, Ryan and I went out to the San Mateo Maker Faire. I'm not sure if it's the San Mateo faire or just the Bay Area. I've heard it both ways.

When I was at Georgia Tech, there was a [Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfaireatl.com/)[^3] and that was a lot of fun to visit. I learned how to pick a lock there.

I've always heard as the Bay Area Maker Faire as _the_ Maker Faire. It was a required pilgrimage.

For me, I finally got see a lot of things I've just read about. I finally got to see the cupcake cars (so cute!) and the life size [Mousetrap](http://lifesizemousetrap.org) in action. The sander races with the stuffed horses were hilarious![^4]

Best of all I got to meet BB-8!

Even though we only went for a day, it was a lot of fun and I'd suggest that anyone should visit. There's a lot of interesting people and creations at the Maker Faire and I'm sure there's something for everyone.
