title: I got a new laptop!

Yesterday, my new laptop that I ordered finally came in! Woo!

I'm excited, because I bought my last MacBook Pro when I started college. It's nice to have a new fast, computer.

It's a Retina MacBook Pro 13-inch Late 2013.

It's got 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB SSD.

I like the retina screen. It took some getting used to, but everything is very clear and it's very clear to me the difference
between a retina and a non-retina screen now.

The reason why I decided to get a 13-inch instead of a 15-inch is because I had a 13-inch laptop during my internship
last summer and I liked that so much I decided I would get a smaller laptop. Plus I don't plan on using it too much
for "hard core" work like I had to do in college.

My old laptop looks ancient when sitting next to my new one. I am not missing it one bit.
