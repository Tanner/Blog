Recently I've started reading a lot of books on [Audible](http://www.audible.com)[^1]. I wanted a way to briefly list my thoughts about the books and never really caught onto [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com).

So I made my own - [Books]({{ site.baseurl }}/books).

It's short, it's simple. There's emoji responses and short thoughts.

[^1]: Or whatever you want to call "reading" for audiobooks. Listening?
