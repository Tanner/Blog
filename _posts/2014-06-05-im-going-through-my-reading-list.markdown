title: I'm going through my Reading List...

While I'm waiting for some salmon to defrost so I can cook it for dinner tonight, I decided to go through my Reading List in Safari[^1].

I use Reading List for a lot of things. The first obvious one is things I want to read later, because they're interesting. I also semi-use it to "bookmark" interesting websites or designs that I liked.

However, it generally becomes an overwhelming stack of sites that at one point I thought were interesting and I have not gotten around to reading… Yeah…

I am proud to say I am pretty good at inbox zero though!

Sometimes I remember why I put a site in the list, sometimes I don't. Some things I find are things I don't really need to read again (another way to use ice and vinegar to clean your garbage disposal).

So here's a list of things that I've currently opened in my tabs:

 - Alex Payne's ["The Case Against Everything Buckets"](https://al3x.net/2009/01/31/against-everything-buckets.html)
 - [Tomas Carnecky](https://caurea.org)
 - [Mark Boulton](http://www.markboulton.co.uk)
 - Realmac's [Ember](http://realmacsoftware.com/ember)
 - [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html)
 - [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com)
 - Trey Griff's ["Let's have coffee"](http://coffee.tgriff3.com)
 - [Derek Brooks](http://derek.broox.com/bio)
