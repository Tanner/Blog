Updated to the newest SpeedTest.Net iPhone app and I accidentally found some "easter eggs".

<a href="http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Mobile-Photo-Sep-14-2010-2-48-25-PM.jpg"><img src="http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Mobile-Photo-Sep-14-2010-2-48-25-PM-200x300.jpg" alt="" title="OOKLA" width="200" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-180" /></a>

To access the easter egg, drag down on the speed dial after you run a speed test. The message will change several times until it no longer exists.

The messages go in this order:
""OOKLA" The cat we named our company after (seriously)"
"He belongs to one of us. But really, he is his own master."
"Attempts to groom him result in blood shed. (Your blood, not his)"
"Therefore, he is in a state of perpetual grooming... Roaming his domain with random chunks of fur shaved away."
"Where did he go?"
"You will see him again soon..."
"IN YOUR NIGHTMARES"

Not sure what they're planning to go with this...

Edit: Yes, the WiFi speed here at Tech is not that hot right now. That's what I get for blogging next to the college of computing...
