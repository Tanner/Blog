When I first heard of PechaKucha, I had no idea what it was. I knew it would probably be some sort of interesting format for doing something like GTD "Get Things Done" or some other organizational process like that, but I really had no idea. I did know that if Dr. Crowther suggested it, it probably would be something quite neat.

So what is PechaKucha? On the [PechaKucha website](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/what), it says PechaKucha is:<blockquote>PechaKucha 20x20 is a simple presentation format where you show 20 images, each for 20 seconds. The images forward automatically and you talk along to the images.</blockquote>The way I understand the format is that it is a way for ordinary people (i.e. anybody and everybody) to present or talk for ~7 minutes about anything they wish to talk about. It seems similar to a TED-ish format, but like is open for anybody to present, not just specific, famous people.

Personally I think this is pretty cool and fantastic. Imagine how many different views you would get on anything if such a thing happened here at Georgia Tech. I just think that would be fantastic. Sure, not all of them would be on specific academic related things, but imagine being able to talk on what you wanted and share it with a large group of people without having to work on anything too elaborate.

For an example of a non-academic presentation, a zoologist shared his "research" on a large, flightless bird in [this presentation](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/presentations/200). The presentation is very interesting and not only provides entertainment, but we also learn a bit about a few other birds and also the creator of the presentation.

No matter what a presentation is on, I could imagine there could be a lot of networking done by the presenters and the audience of a PechaKucha event. You could find people interested in similar things or they might bring up a project they've been working on and you are interested in joining them in development of that project. Fascinating.

There is an [Atlanta PechaKucha group](http://www.atlantapechakucha.com/), though it appears as though they have not met in several months. I still think a Georgia Tech PechaKucha group would be awesome even if met bi-monthly.

What are your thoughts on PechaKucha? Would you have something to show for 6 minutes and 40 seconds?
