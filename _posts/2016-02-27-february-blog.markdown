Ryan says I should blog more. The month of February is almost done and I haven’t written a single thing since January 18th.

I have a few ideas of what to write about, but I still need to think on them a bit more.

As I’m writing this I am self-conscious of how I’m writing due to [this post](http://greig.cc/journal/2016/2/why-you-should-write) I read by [James](http://greig.cc). Am I writing like how I talk? So far, I think so.

Jame’s blog has some other good content. There’s a few more I want to read.

There’s [one about doing things](http://greig.cc/journal/2016/2/if-you-can-do-it-do-it-now) that I need to read again. Oddly enough I found another blog this morning by [Coby Chase](http://cobyism.com/) who wrote about a [similar thing](http://cobyism.com/blog/make-the-decision-once/).

Maybe I’ll take the advice and write more. Perhaps more than once a month (that’d be neat).
