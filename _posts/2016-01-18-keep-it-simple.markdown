Let's keep this (this blog) simple.

Some time ago I read Gina Trapani's blog [post on short-form blogging](http://scribbling.net/2014/10/16/short-form-blogging/).

Her post elaborates a bit more on [the original](http://waxy.org/2014/10/middling/) by Andy (which is worth a read).

I took one piece of Gina's advice on January 11th last year by removing tracking.[^1][^2]

I have no idea how many people are reading my blog now. I don't know if I've lost traffic or gained it. I don't think it's too important right now. Maybe it'll be someday, but I don't think so.

I'd like to work more on other points Gina and Andy point out.

This isn't serious. The posts won't always be long.

It'll be simple.

[^1]: Hurrah git for keeping track of dates and such. It's commit `4ee191a` for the record.
[^2]: I learned you can generate a short commit hash via `git describe --always`. Weird argument name.
