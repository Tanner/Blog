Last weekend the Gwinnett Daily Post took my picture infront of Dad's airplane for an article they're writing about me and my trip across the country.

If you're wondering, "What is this trip across the country?" Here it is in a nutshell. In the week or two before school started I flew across country with my uncle from Lawrenceville, GA to the Ramona, CA (near San Diego, CA) and back touching both oceans. When I say "I flew" it means I, singular, flew the plane across the country. If you want more info on the trip, you can check out the blog for trip [here](http://airborne.revenir.org/).

One of the photos the GDP photographer named Jonathan took is available online for viewing pleasure [here](http://gwinnettdailypost.mycapture.com/mycapture/enlarge.asp?image=31296621&event=1068038&CategoryID=2534). You can also order that stunning picture of me on various products including a coffee mug.

Hopefully the article will be published within the next few days (weeks?) and I'll be able to link to it on here.
