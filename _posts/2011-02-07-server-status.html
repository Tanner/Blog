<a href="http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/uptime.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" title="Uptime" src="http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/uptime.png" alt="" width="550" height="160" /></a>

I found <a href="https://statusdot.com/">statusdot</a> a few days ago and the idea seemed interesting so I signed up for the free beta and set up my site. Now if you point your browser to <a href="http://status.tanner-smith.com/">status.tanner-smith.com</a>, you get a page hosted by statusdot that shows my site's (ergo server) uptime.

Neat, no? I think its a nice little service that is easy to set up and could be quite useful to sites with a bit of traffic which may cause the site to go down frequently.
