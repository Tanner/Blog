Considering the longest running British TV show has never been filmed in the United States, the news that Doctor Who will be filmed in America is quite big.

Yes, myself being an American and a Doctor Who fan, I am very excited about this. Why? Because that means the Doctor will be in the same country! That is like totally awesome. Perhaps a [fez](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Y7M5EAwMdBA/TCeTMa2dIEI/AAAAAAAAAMI/2Z1AO7tPy2Q/S220/fez.jpg) will be involved.

From the press release:
>The BBC announced today that season six of Doctor Who, which delivered record ratings for BBC AMERICA earlier this year, will open with a spectacular two-parter set in the U.S. and penned by 'Who supremo' Steven Moffat.

>In the special two-parter co-produced with BBC AMERICA, key scenes will be filmed in Utah for a story set in the late '60s in which the Doctor, Amy and Rory find themselves on a secret summons that takes them on an adventure from the desert in Utah - right to the Oval Office itself.
