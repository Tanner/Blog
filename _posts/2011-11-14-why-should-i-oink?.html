Around a week ago, Kevin Rose's company <a title="Milk Inc." href="http://milkinc.com/">Milk</a> released their first app for the iPhone - <a title="Oink" href="http://www.oink.com/">Oink</a>. If you don't know about Oink, it is an app where you can rate anything, e.g. a cafe's espresso, a hotel's view, or the annoying bugs at a comedy club. In the app, a user can choose several tags to specialize in and work towards developing credibility for those tags. The more you use Oink for a specific tag, the more credibility you get. That is the basics at least.

I have been using Oink since it was released and in my opinion it is a fantastic app and concept. If I don't like the sweet tea, I can tell Oink that. Though why am I telling Oink that? Yeah, I'm working on building my sweet tea "cred", but still whats the point? There is no use to me having virtual credibility. Currently, at the end of the day, all I'm doing is helping the greater good by informing others which cheese fries are better and that I know this better than anyone else. I'm doing nothing. Yeah, you could see it as though I'm keeping a record for myself of which foods I like and what couch is the best at Tech's student center, which I think is really cool, but that is not much of a motivation to use the app.

What about <a title="foursquare" href="https://foursquare.com/">foursquare</a>? Oink can be described as a foursquare for the things inside places foursquare recoommends. I check into places on foursquare and I get points for it. The amount of points changes depending on whether I've been there before, if the mayor is there, or other properties. I can look at my foursquare leader board and see that <a href="http://www.themattsmith.net/">Matt Smith</a> has 216 points and that I'm behind. How do I get ahead of Matt? I go visit more places. Incentive there.

Foursquare also has a neat deals option that some retailers opt-in for. If you check in and I qualify for a deal (maybe it was like "every other check in") I could get a discount on my burrito. What is better than saving money?

So how does Oink get that incentive to make me use their app? Oink could follow foursquare's lead and add deals if you rate a number of items at a restaurant or retailer. After all, Oink's data is a huge data mine for retailers and restaurants.
