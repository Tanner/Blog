A few weeks ago I got an email asking me whether I desired to be in the Alumni Magazine in the freshman feature, a section that celebrated new students at Georgia Tech who accomplished out-of-the-ordinary goals before entering Tech. I was included due to my <a href="http://airborne.revenir.org/">recent cross-country trip</a>. I affirmatively said "Yes" and answered questions that were asked of me.

You can view the magazine online <a href="http://issuu.com/gtalumni/docs/nov_dec_alumnimag">here</a>. My "article" is specifically on page 53 while the "Freshman Faces" section which I am in is spanning pages 47 to 55. Be sure to check the other students who made the section.
