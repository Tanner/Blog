After I had breakfast this morning I found [this tweet](http://twitter.com/gtcomputing/status/22524181315) by [gtcomputing](http://twitter.com/gtcomputing) about young tweens and their affect on the market for technology.[Here](http://www.financialpost.com/news/tiny+power+shoppers/3452047/story.html) is a link directly to the article.

I don't have time for a full reflection at the moment as I am waiting outside my CS 1331 class with a few friends, but I might write one later.
