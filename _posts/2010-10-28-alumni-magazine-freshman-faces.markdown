A few weeks ago I got an email asking me whether I desired to be in the Alumni Magazine in the freshman feature, a section that celebrated new students at Georgia Tech who accomplished out-of-the-ordinary goals before entering Tech. I was included due to my [recent cross-country trip](http://airborne.revenir.org/). I affirmatively said "Yes" and answered questions that were asked of me.[![](http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_6702-300x200.jpg "Aviation Shot")](http://www.tanner-smith.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_6702.jpg)You can view the magazine online [here](http://issuu.com/gtalumni/docs/nov_dec_alumnimag). My "article" is specifically on page 53 while the "Freshman Faces" section which I am in is spanning pages 47 to 55. Be sure to check the other students who made the section.
