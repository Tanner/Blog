I created this minimalistic, black and white, Georgia Tech for myself a few weeks ago and there was some interest in it so I decided to share it.

You can download it from Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tannerld/5126446612/">here</a>.

Hopefully I'm not breaking GT's copyrights or anything like that.
