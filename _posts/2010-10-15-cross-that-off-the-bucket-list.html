I was adding something to the <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> to-do list application's "Someday" list when I noticed I still had "Fly Across the Country" on the list. Seeing as I have <a href="http://airborne.revenir.org/">already completed</a> this item on my Bucket List, I crossed it off.

One down, a lot more to go...
