I saw this neat clock in my news feeds and found it interesting. It is an interesting contrast between chaos and organization.

In the clock, there is no hour hand, just a minute hand. The hour hand is represented by how shattered the various hours along the clock are. Therefore if the number four is together, then it must be four o'clock. You find the time in-between the hours by using the minute hand and looking around the clock to see which numbers look like they have been the most recently shattered.

Overall, it's a very interesting clock that be nice to have. It also would make quite a neat screensaver.
