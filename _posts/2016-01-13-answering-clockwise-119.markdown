title: Answering Clockwise 119
date: January 13, 2016
---

I listen to the [Clockwise podcast](https://www.relay.fm/clockwise) which is a quick and easy-listening tech podcast hosted by Jason Snell, Dan Moren, and two other rotating guests each week.

It's a nice show that usually covers different topics than other tech shows usually do. Plus I think the intro music sounds _much better_ when sped up 1.6x speed (thanks to Overcast).

I've had the idea in the back of my head that it'd be kind of fun to write my own answers to the questions they ask.
On each show they ask four questions (one for each guest), but sometimes there's a "bonus round" of usually one extra question.

Here's the questions from [episode #119](https://www.relay.fm/clockwise/119)[^1] and my answers.

 > Do you travel, e.g. on vacation, with any other cameras or are you totally smartphone only right now?

I used to have some old Canon Rebel camera, maybe [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_350D). Though that was long ago.

Currently, I don't own any fancy cameras and mainly use my iPhone for photos.

> How smart is your home and if it's not, what are you waiting for?

At some point last year, we purchased some [Philips Hue light bulbs](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/productdetail/philips-hue-white-sk-a19). We loved the ability to change the color and ended up purchasing two more finish off all of our lamps. Their latest [HomeKit base](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/friends-of-hue/apple-homekit/) allows us to use Siri which is nice for getting ready to watch TV shows and heading off to bed.

> What headphones do you use, if any, regularly? Are those the headphones you use on your iPhone?

I currently mainly use blue [Beats Powerbeats2 Wireless](http://www.beatsbydre.com/earphones/MKPQ2.html). I used to use some cheap wired headphones, but I got tired of the cord. For whatever reason, my ears disagree with any of Apple's headphones and don't stay in my ears.

For computer listening, I have some [Sennheiser HD 380 PRO Headphones](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UE6I0G?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00), but I don't use those too often.

> Where are you getting your tech news?

I use RSS for the most part; [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) is my service of choice. I have a small rotation of typical tabs I'll visit throughout the day: Hacker News, Designer News, Mac Rumors, and [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs).

I'm a big fan of Twitter, but I don't think I get that much news from it.

> Are you buying or have you bought your Powerball ticket? If so, what are you going to do with your winnings?

I haven't bought a Powerball ticket. [My chances](http://graphics.wsj.com/lottery-odds/) of winning are so low, it's not really worth trying.

If I did win though, I'd pay off my student loans, go back to [Barcelona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa3NM9Jhkn0), and probably put the rest in savings.

[^1]: Apparently I can't put a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign) in front of the "119" in the title for some reason. Go YAML!
