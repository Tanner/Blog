A while back it was discovered that Apple was unknowingly logging user's locations from their iPhone. I did a bit more research and found an [application](http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/) developed by some guy that would plot the recorded locations on a map.

When I inputted my iPhone backup files to program, I was surprised by the results. The application did work as expected, but apparently the location logging and my backup files extended back to when I did my cross-country. That said, there are positions logged all the way across the United States showing where my Uncle and I landed and stayed for the night.
