Just a tiny post to say that I've got a about.me profile now. Hurrah! You can access it by clicking <a href="http://about.me/tannerld">here</a>.

<a href="http://about.me/">About.me</a> is supposed to be all about consolidating social profiles and what not, which is does well, but I mainly like how it looks. Nice big picture of someone, a bit of bio, and then links to their various social networks or sites. Simple. Nice.

Yep - so that is it for now. Finals for college are almost done and over with, but still got one more to go so I'll get back to studying. Not sure why I am telling you that. Anywho.
