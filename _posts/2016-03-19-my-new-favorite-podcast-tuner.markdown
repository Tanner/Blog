title: My New Favorite Podcast - Tuner
date: March 19, 2016

I have a new favorite podcast.

It's a show called [Tuner](http://www.tuner.show). Their tagline is "There's more to pop that meets the ear".

That's a somewhat confusing tagline, but you can basically think about it as [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org) for music. It's not, however, like [Song Exploder](http://songexploder.net) where musicians take apart their songs.

The two hosts on Tuner look what makes a song likability or unique. They do this by look at all parts of the song: the vocals and all the instruments. What instruments are present? How are they played? They even go so far to play parts of songs on their own guitar and keyboard to show a point whether it's the unique beat or atypical chord progression.

There's also some talk about musical theory, but don't worry they explain it very well.

Tuner doesn't have too many shows yet, 11 at the time of this writing, but here's a few of my favorites and the song(s) the episode is about:

 - [Bonus: Fuller House](http://www.tuner.show/episodes/2016/3/6/bonus-fullest-house) - The Full House and Fuller House theme songs.
 - [#6: Bat Out Adele](http://www.tuner.show/episodes/2015/12/14/6-bat-out-adele) - "Hello" by Adele
 - [#3: Thrill Crazy After All These Years](http://www.tuner.show/episodes/2015/10/25/3-thrill-crazy-after-all-these-years) - "Thriller" by Michael Jackson

Definitely give them a shot. The shows are short (a little less than 20 minutes) and an easy listen.

I wish I could donate some money to the hosts. They do a great job at producing the podcast. I can't wait for more.
