This is so funny I have to post it.

If you have never heard of rickrolling I recommend reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">this</a> and then watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">this</a>.

Amazon has gotten a little crafty with their web page "deals" on the bottom of their main page. If you know the internet meme, I recommend going to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon's website</a>, scrolling to the bottom, and doing a little reading in the bottom right hand corner.

Who says big companies can't have a sense of humor?
