So Humans vs Zombies at Georgia Tech starts tomorrow and will run all week until Saturday. Exciting, no?What are my predictions? Well, for one I know I will have trouble tying a bandana one my forearm with only one hand. Otherwise, I predict I will be dead within 24 hours. If I'm not, gosh I got lucky.I had an idea earlier about using the kill data from the game to do fun analysis on it so I asked a friend of mine to write a script to gather data about the Human vs Zombies event. It will be interesting to see when the amount of kills gets recorded and how the number increases over time. Perhaps I will create a graph of the data afterwords on Saturday or Sunday. Depends how lazy I feel.In other news, I expect myself to be tired tomorrow and hopefully not mobbed by zombies.
