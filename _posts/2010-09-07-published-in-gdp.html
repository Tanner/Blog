Finally got published in the Gwinnett Daily Post about my cross-country trip. The writer, Fenit, did a great job at composing the article.

For those of us who can't get the Gwinnett Daily Post (such as me being in Atlanta) can view the article online <a href="http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/home/headlines/102313859.html">here</a>.

Edit: A link to my article was also included in a AOPA (Aviation Owners and Pilots Association) newsletter. The newsletter can be read <a href="http://www.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=0FDED7B5-CE67-4AC8-AB18-68FCCD8F5298&sid=72d3d143-a754-4f9e-ad27-a397b60dd160">here</a>.
