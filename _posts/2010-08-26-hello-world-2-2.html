For those of you who know programming, you'll get that tiny pun. If not, I am indeed saying hello to the entire world - it is the internet and all.

I hope to get some posts up here about being born digital and random modern technological items I notice. In the meantime, feel free to read my <a href="http://tannerld.wordpress.com/about/">about page</a>.
