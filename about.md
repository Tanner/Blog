Hi there! My name is Tanner Smith.

I'm originally from Atlanta, GA, but I currently live in Redwood City, CA.[^1][^2]

I'm a software engineer at <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> in Cupertino, CA.

I'm never really sure what else to put on an about page. What do people want to know about me?

I could tell you about hobbies. I enjoy computers[^3], aviation, and cooking. Speaking of aviation, I got my pilot's license _just_ after I got my driver's license. I was so close!

TV shows are good to talk about. I could tell you genres I think I like, but I'll just list a few. My favorite TV shows include _Doctor Who_, _Seinfeld_, _Firefly_, _House of Cards_. I think my favorite movie might be _Airplane!_.

I went to school at the Georgia Institute of Technology (aka "Georgia Tech"[^4]) and graduated in the Fall of 2013 with a BS in Computer Science. [Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_(mascot)) is awesome.

I think that's everything I can think of for an about page for now.

If I missed something or you want to know something, feel free to [tweet me](https://twitter.com/tannerld)!
