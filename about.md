title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Tanner Smith and I am a second year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. Hence, therefore I identify as a student and a geek.

There are many identifies that pertain to me whether or not they are obvious. I for one identify as a twin, one of the few freshman at Georgia Tech who are. Perhaps the only set of twins who both go to Georgia Tech this year. Other identities I relate to are white, male, American, born in Georgia, and a pilot. I like to consider myself as a entrepreneur, a maker (i.e. a follower of the Make way of things), and a thinker.

On the flip side, Iâ€™m interested in pretty much anything in life as long as there is something in it that makes it unique. My main interests are computers and flying. I love Doctor Who and several various other television shows.

Writing about ourselves is always fun.
